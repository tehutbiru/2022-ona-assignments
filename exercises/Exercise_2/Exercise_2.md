Exercise 2
================

## Creating Edge tables

Nodes: \[1,2,3,4,5,6,A,B,C,D\] Connections between ‘nodes’:

6 -> 5, 6 -> D, 6 -> B, 1 -> 2, 2 -> A, A -> B, A -> C, B -> C, B -> D,
B -> 3, C -> D, C -> 3, C -> 4, D -> 3, D -> 5, 3 -> 5, 3 -> 4

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
