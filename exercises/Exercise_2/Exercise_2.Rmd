## Creating Edge tables
###### Nodes: [1,2,3,4,5,6,A,B,C,D]
###### Connections between 'nodes': 

6 -> 5, 6 -> D, 6 -> B, 1 -> 2, 2 -> A, A -> B, A -> C, 
B -> C, B -> D, B -> 3, C -> D, C -> 3, C -> 4, D -> 3, 
D -> 5, 3 -> 5, 3 -> 4


```{r cars}


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
